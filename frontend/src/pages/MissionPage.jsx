        The mission of this project is to simplify and accelerate cybersecurity analysis by providing an
        intelligent assistant dedicated to SOC analysts.
      </p>

      <p style={{ ...prose, marginBottom: "1.6rem" }}>
        In traditional workflows, analysts must manually investigate each Indicator of Compromise (IOC) by
        querying multiple platforms and interpreting scattered data. This process is time-consuming and can
        delay incident response.
      </p>

      <p style={{ ...prose, marginBottom: "1.6rem" }}>
        This platform addresses these challenges by centralizing analysis and integrating artificial
        intelligence into the workflow.
      </p>

        The system is designed not to replace analysts, but to enhance their capabilities by reducing
        repetitive tasks and providing faster access to relevant threat intelligence.
