        The platform is built as a centralized Threat Intelligence engine powered by a FastAPI backend.
      </p>

      <p style={{ ...prose, marginBottom: "1.6rem" }}>
        When an IOC is submitted (such as an IP address, file hash, domain, or URL), the system automatically
        sends requests to multiple external threat intelligence sources simultaneously, including services like
        VirusTotal, Shodan, and URL scanning tools.
      </p>

      <p style={{ ...prose, marginBottom: "1.6rem" }}>
        Each source provides partial information about the IOC, such as reputation, known malicious activity,
        or related threats. The platform then aggregates and correlates all these results into a unified and
        structured response.
